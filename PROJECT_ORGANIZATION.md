## 🎉 What Changed

### ✅ Before (Messy)
- 50+ scattered files in root directory
- Hard to find anything
- Mixed purposes in same location
- No clear organization

### ✅ After (Organized)
- Clean folder structure
- Easy to find scripts by purpose
- Logical grouping of related files
- Clear documentation in each folder

## 🚀 How to Use

### Running Database Scripts
```bash
# Setup new database
node scripts/setup/create-tables-direct.js

# Add sample data
node scripts/seeds/add-sample-data.js

# Test connections
node scripts/utils/test-connection.js

# Run migrations
node scripts/migrations/add-missing-columns.js
```

### Finding Documentation
```bash
# Project overview
cat docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md

# Setup guide
cat docs/setup/NEW_SUPABASE_SETUP.md

# Deployment
cat docs/deployment/SUPER_ADMIN_DEPLOYMENT.md
```

### Working with SQL
```bash
# View available SQL scripts
ls sql/setup/

# Check functions
ls sql/functions/
```
