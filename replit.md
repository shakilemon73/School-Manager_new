### Fixed: Post-Login Race Condition - Data Loading & School Name Issues (COMPREHENSIVE FIX)
**Problem**: 
1. After login, dashboard showed infinite loading - data never appeared until browser refresh
2. Wrong school names appeared initially, then changed after a few seconds

**Root Cause**: Race condition between authentication state (`user`) and school ID extraction (`schoolId`):
- Auth provider set `user` and `schoolId` asynchronously in separate state updates
- Navigation triggered immediately when `user` became truthy, before `schoolId` was set
- Dashboard queries executed without valid `schoolId`, causing failures
- Multiple components made redundant async calls to fetch school ID, racing with each other
- React Query cache keys didn't include `schoolId`, allowing cross-tenant data leakage

**Solution Implemented**:

**1. Auth Provider - Synchronized State (`client/src/hooks/use-supabase-direct-auth.tsx`)**
- Added `authReady` boolean flag to track when BOTH `user` AND `schoolId` are available
- Created `extractSchoolIdFromUser()` helper for synchronous school ID extraction from user metadata
- Modified state updates to set `user`, `schoolId`, and `authReady` atomically (all together)
- `authReady` only becomes `true` when both user and schoolId exist

**2. Auth Page - Gated Navigation (`client/src/pages/auth-page.tsx`)**
- Changed navigation trigger from `if (user)` to `if (authReady && user && schoolId)`
- Navigation now waits until auth is fully initialized before redirecting to dashboard
- Added logging: `console.log('✅ Auth ready - navigating to dashboard')`

**3. School Context - Single Source of Truth (`client/src/hooks/use-school-context.tsx`)**
- Removed redundant `schoolId` state and async fetch
- Now uses `schoolId` directly from `useSupabaseDirectAuth()` (single source)
- Eliminated race condition from multiple concurrent school ID fetches

**4. Dashboard Queries - Proper Gating (`client/src/pages/responsive-dashboard.tsx`)**
- All 9 queries updated to include `schoolId` in React Query cache keys for tenant isolation
- Changed `enabled` flag from `!!user` to `authReady && !!schoolId && !academicYearLoading`
- Removed redundant `getCurrentSchoolId()` async function
- Queries now wait for `authReady` before executing

**Before Fix**:
```typescript
// ❌ Race condition
const { user } = useSupabaseDirectAuth();  // Only gets user
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) navigate('/dashboard');  // Navigates before schoolId ready
}, [user]);

useQuery({
  queryKey: ['students'],  // ❌ No tenant isolation
  enabled: !!user  // ❌ Executes before schoolId available
});
```

**After Fix**:
```typescript
// ✅ Synchronized state
const { user, schoolId, authReady } = useSupabaseDirectAuth();
useEffect(() => {
  if (authReady && user && schoolId) {  // ✅ Waits for both
    navigate('/dashboard');
  }
}, [authReady, user, schoolId]);

useQuery({
  queryKey: ['students', schoolId],  // ✅ Proper tenant isolation
  enabled: authReady && !!schoolId  // ✅ Waits for authReady
});
```

**Files Updated**:
- `client/src/hooks/use-supabase-direct-auth.tsx` - Added authReady flag and synchronous school ID extraction
- `client/src/pages/auth-page.tsx` - Gated navigation on authReady
- `client/src/hooks/use-school-context.tsx` - Use single source for schoolId
- `client/src/pages/responsive-dashboard.tsx` - Updated all query cache keys and enabled flags

**Architect Review**: ✅ PASS - "authReady synchronization eliminates post-login race condition"

**Future Improvements** (suggested by architect):
1. Add error UI for users without school_id in metadata
2. Add loading state while authReady is initializing
3. Add monitoring for authReady timing issues

### Previous Fixes
- **Performance**: Changed `count: 'exact'` to `count: 'estimated'` in dashboard queries (12-30x speedup)
- **Students Page**: Removed non-existent `academic_year_id` column filter from students table queries
- **Dashboard Load**: Optimized all dashboard statistics queries with estimated counts

## User Preferences
- Build for production-ready deployment
- Use real data, avoid mocks
- Multi-language support (English, Bengali, Arabic)
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility compliance
- Always use Direct Supabase API calls (no Express routes)
- All new tables must have proper RLS for school isolation
- Update types in `new-features-types.ts` for new tables
- Do not make changes to the file `vite.config.ts`
- Do not make changes to the file `package.json`
- Do not make changes to the file `drizzle.config.ts`

## System Architecture
The system is built as a multi-tenant application with school-based data isolation enforced using Row Level Security (RLS) on Supabase (PostgreSQL). It features a serverless architecture with direct Supabase API integration, eliminating the need for Express middleware, and utilizing Supabase subscriptions for real-time updates. The frontend is developed with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui for a type-safe and modern user experience. Wouter handles routing, and React Hook Form with Zod provides robust form validation.

### UI/UX Decisions
- Modern UI built with TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui.
- Dedicated portals for Admin, Teacher, Student, and Parent roles.
- Responsive design for various devices.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query v5).
- **Routing**: Wouter.
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation.
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with RLS).
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with auto-generated types.

### Feature Specifications
The system includes comprehensive modules for:
- **Academic Management**: Subjects, assignments, interactive timetables, advanced exam scheduling (seating, invigilation).
- **Communication Systems**: Email/SMS notifications, parent-teacher messaging, announcements board.
- **HR & Staff Management**: Leave management, staff attendance, payroll, performance appraisal.
- **Student Welfare Systems**: Hostel management, cafeteria/meal management, disciplinary records, co-curricular activities, health and vaccination records, medical checkups.
- **Admission System**: Online admission portal, admission tests, interviews.
- **Inventory Management**: Vendor management, purchase orders, stock alerts.
- **Reports & Analytics**: Reports dashboard, custom report builder.
- **Core Management**: Student, teacher, parent, staff, finance, library, transport management.
- **Document Generation**: Admit cards, ID cards, fee receipts, mark sheets, transfer certificates.

### System Design Choices
- **Multi-tenant RLS**: All 100+ tables are protected with RLS policies, ensuring strict data isolation per school using a `user_has_school_access` helper function.
- **Direct Supabase API**: All data operations occur directly via the Supabase client, ensuring real-time capabilities and a lean backend.
- **Explicit `school_id`**: All new records must explicitly specify `school_id`; no default values are used to prevent data leakage.

## External Dependencies
- **Supabase**: Primary backend, providing PostgreSQL database, Row Level Security, and real-time capabilities.
- **TanStack Query (React Query)**: For data fetching, caching, and state management.
- **Radix UI primitives via shadcn/ui**: For UI components and design system.
- **Zod**: For schema validation, integrated with React Hook Form.
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool.
