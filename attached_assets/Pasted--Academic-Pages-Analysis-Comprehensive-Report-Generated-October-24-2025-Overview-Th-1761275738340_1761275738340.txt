## 🐛 Common Issues Across All Pages

### 1. **School Isolation**
✅ **GOOD:** All queries filter by `school_id`
✅ **GOOD:** RLS policies should prevent cross-school data access

### 2. **Permission System**
❌ **MISSING:** No role-based access control
❌ **MISSING:** Any logged-in user can:
- Create/edit/delete assessments
- Change grades
- Mark attendance
- Edit timetables

**Needed:**
- Teacher can only edit their assigned subjects
- Parents can only view their child's data
- Students can only view, not edit

### 3. **Data Validation**
⚠️ **PARTIAL:** Client-side validation exists
❌ **MISSING:** Server-side validation in Supabase RLS
❌ **MISSING:** Score validation (can enter 150/100)
❌ **MISSING:** Date validation (can mark attendance in future)

### 4. **Error Handling**
✅ **GOOD:** Try-catch blocks present
⚠️ **PARTIAL:** Error toasts shown
❌ **MISSING:** Detailed error messages
❌ **MISSING:** Retry mechanisms
❌ **MISSING:** Offline support

### 5. **Loading States**
✅ **GOOD:** Skeleton loaders present
✅ **GOOD:** isPending/isLoading checks
⚠️ **PARTIAL:** Some mutations don't show loading

### 6. **Mobile Responsiveness**
⚠️ **PARTIAL:**
- Gradebook: table scrolls but hard to edit
- Timetable: very difficult on mobile
- Attendance: decent but bulk mode cramped
- Assignments: good
- Results: good

### 7. **Bengali Language Support**
✅ **GOOD:** All pages support Bengali
✅ **GOOD:** Field names translate
⚠️ **PARTIAL:** Some error messages still English
❌ **MISSING:** Date formats not localized

### 8. **Search Performance**
⚠️ **ISSUES:**
- Client-side filtering only
- Large class lists slow
- No pagination
- No debouncing on search

**Recommendation:** Server-side search with pagination

### 9. **Export Features**
❌ **BROKEN:**
- Results Management export doesn't work
- Attendance export doesn't work
- Only Gradebook CSV export works

### 10. **Audit Trail**
❌ **MISSING:**
- No history of changes
- Can't see who edited what when
- No version control

---

## 📊 Data Schema Issues

### 1. **Foreign Key Relationships**

**Issues Found:**
```sql
-- attendance table MISSING class_id foreign key
-- Should link to classes table

-- routine_periods MISSING validation
-- No check if teacher assigned to multiple periods

-- assessments uses text class/section
-- Should use foreign keys to classes table
```

### 2. **Missing Indexes**
Performance could be improved with indexes on:
- `student_scores (student_id, assessment_id)`
- `attendance (student_id, date)`
- `routine_periods (routine_id, day_of_week, period_number)`
- `assessments (school_id, class, section, subject_id)`

### 3. **Data Types**
Some inconsistencies:
- `assessments.total_marks` is text, should be numeric
- `assessments.weight_percentage` is text, should be numeric
- `student_scores.score_obtained` is decimal (good)

### 4. **Missing Tables**
Needed for full functionality:
- `assignment_submissions` - Track student submissions
- `attendance_periods` - Period-wise attendance
- `timetable_substitutions` - Teacher substitutions
- `grade_history` - Audit trail for grade changes
- `notification_queue` - Track sent notifications

## 📝 Technical Debt

### Code Quality Issues:

1. **Duplicate Code**
   - Filter dropdowns repeated across pages
   - Create a `<ClassSectionFilter>` component
   - Create a `<StudentSearch>` component

2. **Hardcoded Values**
   - Classes: ['1', '2', ..., '10']
   - Sections: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
   - Should come from database

3. **Type Safety**
   - Some `any` types used
   - Should use proper TypeScript types
   - Leverage shared schema types

4. **Query Organization**
   - Mixed use of query keys
   - Some use `/api/...`, some don't
   - Standardize query key format

### Database Issues:

1. **Schema Inconsistency**
   - Some use `name`/`name_bn`, some use `assessment_name`/`assessment_name_bn`
   - Standardize naming convention

2. **Missing Constraints**
   - No CHECK constraints
   - No UNIQUE constraints where needed
   - No DEFAULT values

3. **RLS Policies**
   - Need comprehensive RLS policies
   - Current security relies on client filtering
   - Implement server-side security

## 🎓 Conclusion

All 5 academic pages are **functional** but **incomplete**. They provide core functionality for:
- Recording grades
- Viewing results
- Marking attendance
- Creating assignments  
- Building timetables

However, they lack:
- Student/parent access
- Submission tracking
- Notification systems
- Permission controls
- Advanced analytics
- Mobile optimization

The pages are **80% complete** from a basic admin perspective, but only **40% complete** for a full school management system that includes students, parents, and teachers.

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix broken export functions
2. Add role-based permissions
3. Connect to student/parent portals
4. Implement notification system
5. Add assignment submission tracking
6. Enhance mobile experience
