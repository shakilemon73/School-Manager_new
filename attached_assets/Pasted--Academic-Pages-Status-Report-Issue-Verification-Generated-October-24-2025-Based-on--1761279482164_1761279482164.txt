## üìù Notes

**Key Findings:**

1. **Export Fixed:** The major complaint about broken exports has been resolved. All 3 main pages (Gradebook, Results, Attendance) now have working CSV/PDF/Excel export with proper data formatting.

2. **Analysis Outdated:** The original analysis document was likely created before the export fixes were implemented. Current code is more advanced.

3. **Security Gap:** The biggest remaining issue is lack of permissions. Any logged-in user has full access to everything in their school.

4. **Portal Gap:** Second biggest issue is no student/parent integration. These pages are admin/teacher-only.

5. **Workflow Gap:** Assignments and Gradebook don't connect properly for the full homework ‚Üí submission ‚Üí grading workflow.
