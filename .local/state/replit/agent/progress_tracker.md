## üîí CRITICAL SECURITY FIX - Row Level Security Implementation

### Issue Identified:
- Schools could see data from other schools (multi-tenant security vulnerability)
- No database-level isolation between different school instances
- Critical security risk for a multi-tenant school management system

### Solution Implemented (All in Supabase Database):

#### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Database Schema Enhancement
- Added `user_school_memberships` table to track user-school relationships
- Configured to support multiple schools per user with role-based access
- Active/inactive membership status tracking

#### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Row Level Security (RLS) Setup
- **Enabled RLS on 100+ tables** in Supabase database containing school_id
- Created `user_has_school_access()` helper functions (supports INTEGER, BIGINT, TEXT types)
- Applied comprehensive isolation policies across entire database

#### ‚úÖ Phase 3: RLS Policies Created
**Critical Tables Secured:**
- ‚úÖ students - Isolated by school_id
- ‚úÖ teachers - Isolated by school_id  
- ‚úÖ staff - Isolated by school_id
- ‚úÖ classes - Isolated by school_id
- ‚úÖ exams - Isolated by school_id
- ‚úÖ attendance - Isolated by school_id
- ‚úÖ fee_receipts - Isolated by school_id
- ‚úÖ schools - Users only see schools they're members of

**All School Data Tables:**
- ‚úÖ 80+ tables with school_id now have RLS policies
- ‚úÖ Policies enforce: `user_has_school_access(school_id)`
- ‚úÖ Database automatically filters all queries by user's school membership

#### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Verification
- RLS enabled status confirmed on all tables
- Policies active and enforcing school isolation
- Multi-tenant security now enforced at database level

### Security Guarantee:
üõ°Ô∏è **Database-level isolation ensures that even if application code has bugs, schools CANNOT access each other's data**

### Technical Details:
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (aws-0-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com)
- **Method**: Row Level Security (RLS) with user_has_school_access() policies
- **Coverage**: All tables with school_id column
- **Policy Type**: FOR ALL (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- **Function**: SECURITY DEFINER functions for policy evaluation
