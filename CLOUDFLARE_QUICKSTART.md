# ⚡ Cloudflare Workers Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 Deploy Your School Management System to Cloudflare in 30 Minutes

---

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Your current codebase (already have it)
- ✅ Node.js installed (already have it)
- ✅ Cloudflare account (free - [sign up here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up))

---

## Step 1: Install Wrangler CLI (2 minutes)

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

---

## Step 2: Login to Cloudflare (1 minute)

```bash
wrangler login
```

This opens your browser for authentication.

---

## Step 3: Configuration Already Done! ✅

The `wrangler.toml` file is already created in your project root. Just review it!

---

## Step 4: Update server/index.ts (5 minutes)

Add this import at the top of `server/index.ts`:

```typescript
// Add at top with other imports
import { httpServerHandler } from 'cloudflare:node';
```

Replace the bottom export section with:

```typescript
// At the very end of the file (around line 420-436)
if (process.env.CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS) {
  // Cloudflare Workers deployment
  export default httpServerHandler({ port: 5000 });
} else if (isServerless) {
  // For serverless environments (Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda)
  console.log("✅ Serverless handler configured for production deployment");
} else {
  // For traditional server environments (Render, Railway, Heroku)
  const host = app.get("env") === "development" ? "127.0.0.1" : "0.0.0.0";
  server.listen({
    port,
    host,
    reusePort: true,
  }, () => {
    log(`🚀 Server running on ${host}:${port} (${app.get("env")} mode)`);
  });
}
```

---

## Step 5: Set Environment Variables (10 minutes)

```bash
# Set all secrets via CLI
wrangler secret put SUPABASE_URL
# Enter: your-supabase-project.supabase.co

wrangler secret put SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# Enter: your-anon-key

wrangler secret put SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
# Enter: your-service-key

wrangler secret put SESSION_SECRET
# Enter: a-random-secret-string

wrangler secret put VITE_SUPABASE_URL
# Enter: your-supabase-project.supabase.co

wrangler secret put VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# Enter: your-anon-key
```

**Tip**: Get your Supabase keys from: https://app.supabase.com → Your Project → Settings → API

---

## Step 6: Build Frontend (2 minutes)

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates the `public/` directory with your compiled React app.

---

## Step 7: Deploy! (5 minutes)

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

Watch the magic happen! ✨

Your app will be live at:
```
https://school-management-system.your-username.workers.dev
```

---

## Step 8: Add Custom Domain (5 minutes)

1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Navigate to: **Workers & Pages** → **school-management-system**
3. Click **Triggers** tab
4. Click **Add Custom Domain**
5. Enter your domain: `school.yourdomain.com`
6. Click **Add Custom Domain**

Done! Your app is now live on your custom domain with automatic HTTPS! 🎉

```

### View Live Logs:
```bash
wrangler tail
```

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Module not found: cloudflare:node"
**Solution**: Make sure compatibility_date is set to "2025-09-15" or later in `wrangler.toml`

### Issue: Environment variables not working
**Solution**: Make sure you set them with `wrangler secret put` NOT in wrangler.toml

### Issue: Frontend not loading
**Solution**: Make sure you ran `npm run build` before deploying

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution**: Your CORS middleware is already configured correctly in `server/index.ts`
